description: Stop all debate agents, delete stale teams and tasks

You are running the **agent-debate cleanup** skill — it tears down any running or stale debate infrastructure.

## Steps

Perform all of the following:

### 1. Delete stale tasks

Call `TaskList` to get all tasks. For every task that exists, call `TaskUpdate` with `status: "deleted"` to remove it.

If there are no tasks, skip this step.

### 2. Clean up debate teams

Look for team config files:
```bash
ls ~/.claude/teams/*/config.json 2>/dev/null
```

For each team whose description contains "debate" (case-insensitive):
1. Read the config to check for active members (up to 3 debate agents: critic, advocate, judge)
2. Send a `shutdown_request` to any active teammates
3. Remove the team directory and its matching task directory:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.claude/teams/<team-name> ~/.claude/tasks/<team-name>
   ```

**Do NOT delete teams that are not debate-related** (e.g., skip teams for other projects).

### 3. Clean up debate output (only if requested)

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains "all" or "full", also remove the debate output:
```bash
rm -rf debate-output/
```

Otherwise, leave `debate-output/` intact so the user can still review results.

### 4. Report

Tell the user what was cleaned up:
- How many tasks were deleted
- Which teams were removed
- Whether debate-output was cleared
