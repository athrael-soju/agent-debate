# Agent Debate Output Style

## Round Summaries (`round-N.md`)

Each round file should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Round N

## Critic's Arguments
[Structured critique with severity ratings]

## Advocate's Defense
[Point-by-point rebuttal with evidence]

## Judge's Assessment
[Impartial evaluation of both sides]

## Round Summary
[Scribe's neutral summary: resolved issues, open issues, concessions, trajectory]
```

## Final Synthesis (`final-synthesis.md`)

The final synthesis should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Debate Synthesis: [Topic]

## Debate Overview
- **Topic**: [Full topic statement]
- **Rounds completed**: N
- **Termination**: [Early ruling / Full rounds completed]

## Points of Agreement
[Issues where both sides converged]

## Concessions
[What each side conceded and why]

## Dismissed Arguments
[Arguments the judge found unpersuasive, with reasoning]

## Judge's Rulings
[Per-issue: ACCEPTED / REJECTED / REVISION REQUIRED]

## Unresolved Disagreements
[Issues that remained contested]

## Verdict
[Judge's final assessment of the overall position]
```

## Formatting Guidelines

- Use clear markdown headers for structure
- Quote specific arguments when referencing them
- Use bullet points for lists of issues/arguments
- Include severity ratings where applicable (Critical / Major / Minor)
- Keep language precise and analytical — no rhetorical flourishes in summaries
